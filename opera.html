    <h3>HMS Pinnafore ACT II</h3>
    <h4 class = "name"> Night. Awning removed. Moonlight.</h4>
    <p></p>CAPTAIN discovered
        singing on poop deck, and accompanying himself on a
        mandolin. LITTLE
        BUTTERCUP seated on quarterdeck, gazing sentimentally at
        him.</p>
    <h6 class = "CAPT">CAPT.</h6>
    <p class="song">CAPTAIN AND BUT

                      Fair moon, to thee I sing,
                        Bright regent of the heavens,
                      But now my kindly crew rebel,
                        My daughter to a tar is partial,
                      Sir Joseph storms, and, sad to tell,
                        He threatens a court martial!
                         Fair moon, to thee I sing,
                           Bright regent of the heavens,
                         Say, why is everything
                           Either at sixes or at sevens?</p>
  <h6 class = "BUT">BUT.</h6> <p>How sweetly he carols forth his melody to the
  unconscious
  moon! Of whom is he thinking? Of some high-born beauty? It may
  be! Who is
  poor Little Buttercup that she should expect his glance to fall
  on one so
  lowly! And yet if he knew—if he only knew!</p><br>
  <h6 class = "CAPT">CAPT.</h6> <p><p class="direction">(coming down).</p> Ah! Little Buttercup, still on board?
  That is
  not quite right, little one. It would have been more respectable
  to have
  gone on shore at dusk.</p><br>
  <h6 class = "BUT">BUT,</h6><p class="speech"> True, dear Captain—but the recollection of your sad
  pale
  face seemed to chain me to the ship. I would fain see you smile
  before I
  go.</p><br>
  <h6 class = "CAPT">CAPT.</h6> <p class="speech"> Ah! Little Buttercup, I fear it will be long before I
  recover my accustomed cheerfulness, for misfortunes crowd upon
  me, and
  all my old friends seem to have turned against me!</p><br>
  <h6 class = "BUT">BUT,</h6><p class="speech"> Oh no—do not say "all", dear Captain. That were
  unjust to
  one, at least.</p><br>
  <h6 class = "CAPT">CAPT.</h6><p class="speech">True, for you are staunch to me. <p class="direction">(Aside.)</p> If ever I
  gave my
  heart again, methinks it would be to such a one as this!<p class="direction">(Aloud.)</p>
  I am
  touched to the heart by your innocent regard for me, and were we
  differently situated, I think I could have returned it. But as it
  is, I
  fear I can never be more to you than a friend.</p><br>
  <h6 class = "BUT">BUT,</h6> <p>I understand! You hold aloof from me because you are
  rich and
  lofty—and I poor and lowly. But take care! The poor bumboat
  woman has
  gipsy blood in her veins, and she can read destinies.</p><br>
  <h6 class = "CAPT">CAPT.</h6><p> Destinies?</p><br>
  <h6 class = "BUT">BUT.</h6> <p>There is a change in store for you!</p><br>
  <h6 class = "CAPT">CAPT.</h6><p> A change?</p><br>
  <h6 class = "BUT">BUT.</h6> <p>Aye—be prepared!</p><br>
